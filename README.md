# Troika LaTeX Example

This is an example project, which shows all of the formatting styles and custom LaTeX commands I use
to format Troika! adventures into reasonably well-presented PDFs.

## How To Use This Repository

I strongly recommend using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) for your LaTeX projects. It's free
to use, and massively reduces the headache of manually configuring LaTeX.

Once you have an account on Overleaf, and have created your first blank project, you can download
all the files in this GitHub repository as a zip file from
[this link](https://github.com/MikeKneeB/Troika-Example-Project/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). You
can also clone the repository, using: `git clone https://github.com/MikeKneeB/Troika-Example-Project/`
if you don't have `git` installed I suggest downloading the zip file.

After downloading and extracting the contents of the zip file to a sensible location, you can
upload them all to your blank project in Overleaf. (You will need to delete the existing `main.tex`
file if it exists in your blank project.) Now you can start looking through the project, adding your
own content, and hacking the layout elements to pieces to make something you're happy with!

I've included comments in these files for how the different commands work, and how they can be
changed.

This example project is *not* a beginner's guide. For a full run-down of how to use LaTeX in general
I recommend the [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/learn) documentation.

## Attribution and License

The markdown files in this project are licensed under the
[BSD Zero Clause License](https://opensource.org/license/0bsd). In summary, this means you can make
use of these files in any way you like, with no restrictions of any kind. You are not required to give
any attribution to me, however, if you found the files useful and would like to give an attribution
it would be appreciated. You can include the following in your LaTeX document (perhaps on a copyright
page if someone had usefully provided an environment for just that purpose):

```latex

Again, this is optional, and you are under no obligation to include this message.

## Released Examples

My Troika! adventures so far have used these (or earlier incarnations of) `setup/predoc` and `main` files to
get started.

You can see them "in action" in:
- [The Worm's Finger](https://gentlyrotting.itch.io/the-worms-finger)
- [Subcutaneous](https://gentlyrotting.itch.io/subcutaneous)
- [The Lands Between Troika!](https://gentlyrotting.itch.io/the-lands-between-troika)

If you create a project using these setup files, and would like it to be included in this list, please
drop me a message at gently.rotting.prd@gmail.com.

## Feedback and Support

I can't provide direct LaTeX support to anyone, so please don't raise issues against this repository or
email me with issues unless you are certain they are related to the files in this project as provided.

I am happy to take any suggestions or feedback via issues raised here.
